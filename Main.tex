\abs{This paper will establish the Molecular Topological Index $MTI$ of the Monocyclic Graph $C_k(s,t)$ by calculating its Degree Distance Index and Zagreb Index. The general equation of the MTI of $C_k(s,t)$ will be derived from the general formula of the Wiener Index, Degree Distance Index and Zagreb Index of the Monocyclic graph $C_k(s,t)$ that is shown by this study. The calculations of their indices will depend on the parameters $k,s,t$ of the graph $C_k(s,t)$}
